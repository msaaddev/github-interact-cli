## 🏗 SETUP

Type the following in the terminal to run the CLI.

```
github
```

CLI will start running. It will ask you to add a **Personal Access Token** & your **GitHub Username**. If you don't know what Personal Access Token is & how to create one, check this [awesome guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) by GitHub.

`！Note:` Be sure to give the token _repo_, _admin:repo_hook_ & _delete repo_ scopes .

Once you are done, exit the CLI so that configurations can be saved & used again.
